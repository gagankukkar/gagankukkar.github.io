  Welcome to my site! I'm a detail-oriented problem solver and natural born leader with 5+ years professional experience in a variety of industries. 

  My background in engineering has given me the ability to absorb new information efficiently and analyze problems in a creative way.

  I've mastered my ability to work effectively in a team, as well as communicate with technical and non-technical audiences alike. 

  Looking for an opportunity where I can take advantage of my soft and hard skills to provide value to a meaningful organization.

          In 1957, Waterloo opened its doors to 74 engineering students with co-operative education as its cornerstone. Today, with more than 42,000+ students attending annually, Waterloo is #1 in Canada for experiential learning and employer-student connections.

          During my time at Waterloo I learned many key skills that I have taken with me through my career such as teamwork and working with tight deadlines. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at university and learned a lot about a healthy work-life balance.

          I had the opportunity to gain professional work experience while in school through the co-op program which strengthened my education.

          I spent a lot of my free time as the *Mechanical Engineering Class Rep* to ensure successful student-professor relations.

            I served as the liaison between the Support team and Engineering teams. I investigated technical issues reported by customers to resolve them as soon as possible. I also took ownership of the software used by the Support team to manage customer and product data. As a result, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of individuals to drive excellent customer experience while developing high-quality software for better internal productivity.

            As part of the Energy business unit, I performed mechanical and electrical testing of high-voltage  connector samples to maximize product quality. I led a new capital project to successfully progress it from its initial phase to prototyping phase in the product's development life cycle. Lastly, I explored and implemented new technologies to provide cost-savings related to the inspection of production samples.
